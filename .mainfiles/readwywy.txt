Oh no! I wanna get a youtube video but don't have it as a sound file!

sometimes pygame is weird and different file formats don't work.

try wav and ogg files. 
I Recommend Wav very much but it takes more (still very little) of disc space

Oh no! I wanna convert files but 3 at a time is too slow!

drag 5 files at a time and wait for them to convert. You only need to press download button once.

So almost 2 times less dragging and a lot of saving of clicks.

Make shortcuts for the batch files to open the playlist straight from your desktop or a desired location.

I heard SH files are for mac, and I don't know if they work. Soooo, yeah.

DISCLAIMERS ---------- DISCLAIMERS

MOST IMPORTANT - BE RESONABLE. Don't delete anything you don't know its purpose. It might crash the program.
(Why would it be there if it had no purpose?)

If the program crashes or is frozen, try closing it (ending the task is fine) and rebooting the program.
If python threw an exception, just tell me what happened (99.9999% of the time you did some whacky combination of commands that did something weird)
Speaking of shouting at me: only shout at me when you can reproduce what happened.
Also, I need error messages. Just run the debug and it will pause instead of timing out so you can see what the error was.
(I would like the know the config as well, maybe because it does some whacky stuff)
Don't rush me. I'm a normal human. I won't really fix it in a snap.
Don't scream at me for mistakes. I make them all of the time! Just like you :)
*Sometimes pygame crashes randomly when initailizing. Again, just reboot.

If somehow you manage to corrupt some files, try deleting the log (.mainfiles\log.txt).
If that doesn't work, try a fresh download (This'll work unless pythons poopie)

Have fun! - Wywy and Eric.
