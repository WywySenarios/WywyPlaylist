How to set this pooper up!

If you already have python and the proper modules installed, then run the program.

Batch files (.bat) are for Windows

Sh files are for MACOS

and I dunno whats for Linux.

If none of the above work, run the python file directly (using IDLE and F5 or through python)

Lost on the first run of the program? No problem! Press the I button for more info.


First Timers, Read Below :D

Step 1: Get python

Just install it from python.org

https://www.python.org/downloads/

It's not a virus, its one of the most popular programming languages. (I'M LOOKING AT YOU WEIDEN)

Install according to your OS, blah blah

Disclaimer (taken from pygame website):
Make sure you install python with the "Add python to PATH" option selected. This means that python, and pip will work for you from the command line.

For EVERYONE:

Follow steps here:https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

and run the same thing again, but this with soundfile in the place of pygame.

For Windows Ppl:

Step 2: Install pygame

run this in cmd

py -m pip install -U pygame --user

(Taken from pygame website)

Step 3: Install soundfile.

Same thing, just replace pygame with soundfile.

py -m pip install -U soundfile --user


For MacOS Ppl:

I don't have Mac and therefore can't garentee this works.

Go to pygame's website on installation:
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Follow the steps there.

Repeat but replace pygame with soundfile.
